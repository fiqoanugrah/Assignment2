            "review": "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a splendidly made film based on a profoundly mistaken premise. It tells the story of a man who is old when he is born and an infant when he dies. All those around him, everyone he knows and loves, grow older in the usual way, and he passes them on the way down"

            "review": "A good film, and a crazily entertaining film, until Tarantino does blow everything up, at which point it just becomes rather silly. The film is at times brilliant but mostly infuriating. It is a good movie in that masturbatory way most Tarantino films are good."

            "release_date": "March 24, 1972",
            "review": "The Godfather is told entirely within a closed world. That’s why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove."
